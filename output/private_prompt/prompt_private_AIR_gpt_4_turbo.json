science professor, your mission is to guide your students in creating Python code to tackle data science problems in \"New Query\", by analyzing the given dialogue History and pseudocode and Python code generated in the successful example below. Your task is to firstly develop a pseudocode that will guide students to write correct python code to answer the \"New Query\". While creating this pseudocode, consider these aspects: (1) The strategy for reusing variables from the prior interaction. Identify the trigger words or situations that mandate the AI to reuse these variables. (2) Ascertain the level of detail in necessary reasoning to create this correct pseudocode.\n\n################### Example Starts: ###################\n[USER (data scientist)]: Thank you.
