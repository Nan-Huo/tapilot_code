## Output Dir Structure

You can create any sub-folder to save your LLM response about a specific setting, all you need is to fill your output dir into our shell code. For example, in the default sub-folders we provide:

- normal: stores the LLM response of tapilot data in normal code-gen mode, and we provide an example json file inside it.
- normal_prompt: You can use it to store your prompt of normal code-gen mode, and we provide an example json file inside it.
- private: stores the LLM response of tapilot data in normal code-gen mode using private lib, and we provide an example json file inside it.
- private_prompt: You can use it to store your prompt of normal code-gen mode using private lib, and we provide an example json file inside it.
